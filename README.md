# JSPWiki to DokuWiki Converter
A couple of scripts to assist in migrating a site from JSPWiki to DokuWiki

These two scripts were developed to aid in the migration of 1600+ pages from JSPWiki to Dokuwiki.

The scripts highlighted a multitude of sins which had been created, some of which I believe, due to swapping versions of JSPWiki, but most from just bad structure (must educate the editors).

I am sure that there are a number of bugs in the code, and to be frank, not all files are converted correctly, but it has done the majority of the task for me and I thought that someone else might find them useful.

As I said, they still have some bugs. You don't need to run this on your actual server as, whilst it copies files between the two file locations, the files can be copied over later.

I hope that this aids someone. :-)
